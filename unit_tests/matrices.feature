      |  3 | 2 | 1 | -1 |
      |  4 | 3 | 6 |  5 |
      |  1 | 2 | 7 |  8 |
  Then A * B is the following 4x4 matrix:
      | 20|  22 |  50 |  48 |
      | 44|  54 | 114 | 108 |
      | 40|  58 | 110 | 102 |
      | 16|  26 |  46 |  42 |

#Scenario: A matrix multiplied by a tuple
#  Given the following matrix A:
#      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
#      | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 |
#      | 8 | 6 | 4 | 1 |
